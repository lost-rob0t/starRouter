* StarRouter
Star Router is a zeromq based messaging broker for starintel.

Note, this is not even alpha quality.
Also do not expose this to the web, a solution for that will come.



** Installation
nimble for some reason... fails to compile but still it will get the depps needed.

Install deps and fail
#+begin_src shell
nimble install
#+end_src

Then when that erros compile by hand.

#+begin_src shell
nim c -d:release -o:./starRouter src/starRouter.nim
#+end_src

then copy that to someplace into your path.

There is optional jsony support for faster parsing of msgs, if you want that you should install jsony.
compile with ~-d:useJsony~ to use it.

** Compile options

+ useJsony: enable jsony support.
